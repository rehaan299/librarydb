Language Choice: We  implemented the system in Python due to its ease of use, extensive libraries for both SQLite database management and command-line interface development, and familiarity among team members.

Testing: Tested the application with various scenarios using both mock data.
Ensured compatibility with the provided database file by accepting the database filename as a command-line argument.
Conducted thorough testing of each functionality to verify correctness and robustness.

Coordination Method: Weekly Google Meets to discuss the progress made so far and possible issues faced by group members in their respective parts. Set up a google chat to stay up-to-date with any possible complications so we can deal with them in a timely manner. This ensured good communication within the group and allowed everyone to finish their tasks in a timely manner.
